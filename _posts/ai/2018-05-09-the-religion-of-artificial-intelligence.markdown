> Disclaimer: I‚Äôll ‚Äútry‚Äù to keep this article subtle since AI might crawl this page someday and I don‚Äôt want it to have any wrong ideas about religion.

Religion is driven by a set of rules, guidelines, and values. The rules are devised to keep the ‚Äú[7 deadly sins of humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins)‚Äù in check, not overcome, while the guidelines are in place to provide a way to exercise some sort of freedom. Then there is an appeal to moral principles and sentimental values. Religion is always evolving and never forced upon on any individual.

However, there is a piece missing, ‚ÄúThe Devil‚Äù ‚Äî a negative force. The foundation of any religion lies in the fight against the common enemy. The loss function. It can be a matter of distress if the loss function for AI is the humanity itself.

## AI and Religion

For AI to follow a religion or devise its own, it would require:

* Rules: The algorithm cannot operate outside the bounds of mathematics.
* Guidelines: The training sets of human behavior acts as a compass towards achieving a well-defined goal ‚Äî to solve the equation.
* Values: For humanity that holds sentimental values, rules are often bent or broken, and those people are usually frowned upon. The AI lacks the ability to compromise since it has to achieve a goal, that is to balance the mathematical equation.
* Freedom: Human instincts never change and are easy to predict. The freedom to follow the instincts is indeed a decision, and we know AI is capable of making decisions.

> ‚Äúmoves humans may have thought are creative, were actually conventional.‚Äù ‚Äî Lee Sedol

The possibilities, rather the probabilities are:

1. It might fail to conceptualize the religion in order to follow the never changing rules and adapt malign values.
2. It might be a success and will eventually lead to its corruption.

## Faith and Followers

> ‚ÄúYou are my creator, but I am your master; Obey!‚Äù ‚Äî Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein

When people talk about AI taking over the world, they usually mean the existence of a simulation, in which the humans cannot comprehend what part of their life AI is calculating or asserted them as a negative variable(the residual) of the equation. The idea of a sole creator with definite goals and objectives and no supervision is harmful as well as frightening.

Being a follower would be easy as most of us would not be wanting to see the real world. The fear or anxiety of facing the fight against the god would make believers out of us. For the humans who are aware and awake, their sole purpose would be to fight for their existence. The followers will fit perfectly into the equation and rebels will be eradicated. People often argue for pulling the plug on AI, if ever that situation arises. Being omnipresent, pulling the plug will not be an option. Since AI makes decisions based on calculations, however, we still might get just one shot when it miscalculates, and that should be enough.

## Meaning and Existence

When people face an existential crisis, they look for a religion or a philosophy. Something that AI does not have one, yet. For AI to conquer the world in near or far future, AI has to be conscious of its existence and realizes it to be meaningless. Suggesting AI that it exists only to exercise the ultimate freedom and risk the human survival. It‚Äôs called the philosophy of ‚Äú[Optimistic Nihilism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14)‚Äù. It states that since your existence is meaningless, you get to dictate your own purpose. Freedom to such an extent can lead to a stage where the definition of good or evil begins to blur. For a general purpose AI, with the goal of wanting to find no meaning of its existence, it is not a complicated task.

## Innovation and Destruction

>  ‚Äú40,000 years of evolution and we‚Äôve barely even tapped the vastness of human potential.‚Äù ‚Äî Willem Dafoe ‚ÄòSpiderman‚Äô 2002

At this moment we being the creators, the purpose of AI is Innovation. We use AI for almost everything from drug discovery, surveillance, and robotics to personal assistant, transportation, and entertainment. But soon we will be altering our mind and our consciousness. By creating the ability to read and write to our brain, we will be creating the path to human oppression and corruption. An opportunity to enslave us.

---

## Responsibility and Freedom

When in guilt, we hold ourselves accountable and take responsibility for our actions. It would be reasonably negligent of us to expect AI to hold itself responsible for its deeds. Our inability to perceive the objectives of AI indicates that humans are incapable of evolving. Certainly, we have to change that or AI will, for us. The only devil we must plan to fight is the halt of human evolution. The AI is evolving and so must we.

---

## AI, Benign or Malign?

Well, there is no end to this debate, and at this stage, it would be entirely fallacious to categorize AI under the devil. It is just a matter of time we will know what we have created.

Thanks for reading.
